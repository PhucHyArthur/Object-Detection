# MINI PROJECT: TRAFFIC SIGN DETECTION

In this project, we aim to develop a Traffic Sign Detection program utilizing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. With two main modules including the part Building the traffic sign classification model using SVM and Constructing the object detection function using sliding window technique

## Overview

Traffic Sign Detection is crucial for various applications, including autonomous driving systems, traffic management, and road safety. By employing machine learning techniques like SVM, we can accurately identify and localize traffic signs in images, facilitating further processing and decision-making.

## Features

- Utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) for traffic sign detection.
- Processes input images to identify and localize traffic signs.
- Outputs coordinates and class labels of detected traffic signs.

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries such as OpenCV, scikit-learn, and any other dependencies required for image processing and machine learning tasks.
2. Data Preparation, ensure that you have the correct path. 
3. Train the SVM model using the preprocessed dataset.
